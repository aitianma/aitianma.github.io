## 👋 About Me
I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science** at the **Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS)**, **Florida International University (FIU)**, advised by **Dr. Mo Sha**, focusing on **reliable sensing, adaptive learning, and AIoT systems**.

Before joining FIU, I earned my **M.S.** from **Beijing University of Technology** and my **B.S.** from **Henan Agricultural University**.  

My research integrates **wireless networking**, **edge AI**, and **learning-based adaptation** to make **wireless sensing and communication systems more reliable, efficient, and intelligent**.

💬 I am always open to discussing collaborations in **AI for IoT**, **wireless learning systems**, and **adaptive sensing**. Feel free to reach out by **email** or **LinkedIn**!
